# 🎨 Marker Picker

Overthinking kills momentum. Marker Picker exists to fix that.

**Marker Picker** is a small app I’m building to remove decision fatigue when coloring.

It helps you pick a marker so you can just start, instead of staring at your collection wondering where to begin.

## The Solution

* Pick a marker from a defined set or palette
* Reduce friction
* Get coloring faster

## Current Capabilities

* Simple marker selection
* Minimal UI designed to stay out of the way

## What’s Next

* **Multiple random picks**
  Decide the number of colors you want to be chosen for you all at once, and color away!

* **Marker Sets**
  Create and choose from predefined sets (e.g. *SFAIH 101-count*, custom collections, etc.)

* **Palettes (Color Groups)**
  Build and select palettes within a set—warm tones, cool tones, red & green, chaos mode, you name it.

* **Split Screens (Coloring With Friends)**
  Multiple side-by-side pickers so each person can use their own marker set and/or palette while coloring together.


## Why This Exists

- Because starting matters more than choosing the “right” color.
- I get to learn React and how to build small web apps with intention.
